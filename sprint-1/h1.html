    <div class="c10" class="f5" id="b5">
        <p>The fingerboard was made a little longer to be able to play even the highest notes (in the 19th century).</p>
        <p>The fingerboard was tilted a little more, to produce even more volume as larger and larger orchestras became popular.</p>
        <p>Nearly all old instruments were modified, including lengthening of the neck by one centimeter, in response to the raising of pitch that occurred in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The bass bar of nearly all old instruments was made heavier to allow a greater string tension.</p>
        <p>The classical luthiers "nailed" and glued the instrument necks to the upper block of the body before gluing on the soundboard, while later luthiers mortise the neck to the body after completely assembling the body.</p>
        <p>The chinrest was invented in the early 19th century by Louis Spohr.</p>
