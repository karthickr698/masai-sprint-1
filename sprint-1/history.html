        <p id="id2">Improved posture: Another one of the benefits of playing violin is that it requires you to sit up straight and tall.</p>
        <p id="id2">Sharpened memory: Your muscle memory will improve as you become more proficient at playing violin.</p>
        <p id="id2">Enhanced self-discipline: The only way you can expect to improve is by practicing. Itâ€™s not a task you can hand off to someone else.</p>
        <p id="id2">Increased feelings of accomplishment: When you dedicate yourself to learning the violin, it can feel like an awesome accomplishment.</p>
